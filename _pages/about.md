<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an associate professor in [John Hopcroft Center](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests include AR/VR, avatars/characters, 3D animations, HCI, and computer graphics. Previously, I was an Associate Research Scientist in AR/VR at Disney Research Los Angeles. I received the B.Sc. degree in communication and information engineering from Purdue/UESTC in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree in computer graphics from the University College London (UCL) in 2015. I has served as Associate Editor of the International Journal of Human Computer Studies, and a regular member of IEEE virtual reality program committees.

I am looking for self-motivated PhD, master and undergraduate students to join my research group. My E-mail address is **whitneypanye@sjtu.edu.cn**. Please contact me if you are interested.

[Preserving gaze direction in teleconferencing using a camera array and a spherical display (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6365433)

**Ye Pan**, Anthony Steed

- The movement of human gaze is very important in face to face conversation. Some of the quality of that movement is lost in videoconferencing because the participants look at a single planar image of the remote person. We use an array of cameras to capture a remote user, and then display video of that person on a spherical display. We compare the spherical display to a face to face setting and a planar display. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the camera array and spherical display system in that it allows observers to accurately judge where the remote user is placing their gaze.
